== Configuration

The flow definition will be in a static block called `fsm_def`, which can hold several flow definition, each of them tied to one property in the class, such as:

[source, groovy]
----
static fsm_def = [
    <flow-property> : [
        <initial-value> : { <flow-definition-closure> }
        ],
    <another-flow> : [
        <initial-value-2> : { <flow-definition-closure> }
        ]
    ]

----

Every closure will use the `on`, `from`, `to`, `when` and `act` clauses to define the desired behavior. The structure of the flow definition closure is as follows:

[source, groovy]
----
{ flow ->
  flow.on (<event>) {
    from (<source>) [
        .when ( { <condition to allow the transition, must return boolean> })
    ].to (<destiny>) [
        .act ({ <code to run if success> })
    ]
  }
}
